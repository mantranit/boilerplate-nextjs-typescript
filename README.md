# Next.js with TypeScript and ESLint

Starter code for a clean Next.js + TypeScript + ESLint project.

## Get started

```sh
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Enable husky
yarn husky install

# Start dev server
yarn dev
```

## From Create-Next-App

Some differences are:

- Using `npx tsconfig.json` for Nextjs
- Husky package
- ESLint and Prettier are integrated with VSCode
- Lint-staged package: linting will only happen on staged files, not all file
